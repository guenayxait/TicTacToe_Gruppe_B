# TicTacToe_Gruppe_B

# Context
Embarking on your journey as a new game studio, you're immersing yourselves in the software lifecycle by initiating your first project: designing, developing, testing, and iterating upon a digital rendition of the timeless game, Tic-Tac-Toe. This endeavor not only showcases your team's technical prowess but also underscores your commitment to mastering the intricacies of the software development process.

# User Stories
- As a player, I want to be able to make a move by choosing an empty square, so that I can place my symbol on the board.
- As a player, I want to be able to see the current state of the game, so that I can keep track of the moves made by both myself and my opponent.
- As a player, I want to be notified when the game has ended in a win, loss or draw, so that I can see the result of the game.
- As a player, I want to be able to start a new game after the current game has ended, so that I can play again.

# Tasks
- Create a GitHub repository (public)
- Create a GitHub project and link it to the created repository
- Transfer the user stories to a new Kanban board in the project
- Give every user story a unique id
